## 1. Key Information

You are being asked to allow the use of your health information for research.  
Before you decide, please read this form carefully and ask any questions you may
have. Your participation is completely voluntary.

---

## 2. Purpose of the Research

The purpose of this research is to improve understanding of health conditions
and care delivery by analyzing de-identified patient data. Your data may help
develop better tools, treatments, and technologies for patients in the future.

---

## 3. Procedures

If you agree:

- Researchers will use data already collected as part of your care.
- No additional tests or visits are required.
- **HIPAA de-identification categories:**
  - **De-identified under HIPAA §164.514(b):** Not PHI; no Authorization required.
  - **Limited Data Set (LDS) under HIPAA §164.514(e):** External disclosures for research, public health, or health care operations require a Data Use Agreement (DUA); Authorization or waiver is not required for those purposes; institutional/IRB approvals may still apply.
  - **Identifiable PHI:** Requires your HIPAA Authorization or an IRB/Privacy Board–approved waiver of Authorization.
  - **Note:** “Coded”/pseudonymized data that can be re-identified by the holder remain PHI under HIPAA.
- Data may be shared with approved research partners or institutions under strict confidentiality agreements and Data Use Agreements where applicable.
- Only authorized personnel will access your information.

---

## 4. Risks and Discomforts

There are no physical risks to you. Although every effort will be made to
protect your privacy, there is a small risk that someone could identify you from
shared data.

**Security measures:**

- Data will be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Access is role-based (least privilege), logged, and audited.
- Regular security assessments are performed.

---

## 5. Benefits

There may be no direct benefit to you. However, your data may help researchers
advance medical knowledge, improve diagnostic tools, or develop better
treatments.

---

## 6. Confidentiality and Data Protection

- Personal identifiers (e.g., name, address) will be removed or replaced with a
  study code.
- Data will be retained for [insert duration according to law/IRB] or until the
  completion of the study, then securely destroyed or archived in de-identified
  form.
- International transfers will follow appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard
  Contractual Clauses, Transfer Impact Assessment), and participants can request
  copies.
- All use of your information will comply with applicable privacy laws (e.g.,
  HIPAA, GDPR).
- **Note:** Copies of SCCs may be redacted to protect confidential or commercially sensitive information.

---

## 7. Voluntary Participation

Taking part in this research is your choice. Refusing will not affect your
medical care or relationship with your healthcare providers.

---

## 8. Withdrawal of Consent

You may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting the research team. After
withdrawal:

- New uses of your data will cease.
- Downstream partners will be instructed to stop processing and delete/destroy
  data where feasible.
- Data already used in analyses, publications, or shared de-identified datasets
  cannot be retracted.
